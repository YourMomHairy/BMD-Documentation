## Paid hosting

## Free hosting
So you want to host your bot but don't want to pay extra for a VPS (Virtual Private Server)?

Well, then you're on your own. Something like a free host simply doesn't exist. Sure, it may be free as in no payment required, but in this world, how can something be free, especially a piece of hardware? It's simple: you're paying with your data and probably your time, or the host will fall apart in less than a year.

So should you use a free host? In my opinion (and probably some others here): nope. Just don't do it. Pay for a small VPS from a good provider and you will have something with stability and assurance that your bot will stay online (as long as you pay). Also, when buying a VPS, you can run other things besides the Discord bot (because your bot probably doesn't have a high usage count if you're asking for a free host), like other Discord bots, Pi-hole, or a lightweight VPN etc.

Some personal recommendations for hosts:
- Hetzner Cloud: https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/
- Contabo: https://contabo.com/en/vps/
- Linode: https://www.linode.com/

P.S.: Please secure your server properly. Search online about fail2ban, changing the SSH port, and using SSH keys <:thumbsup:1247607851917119529>
