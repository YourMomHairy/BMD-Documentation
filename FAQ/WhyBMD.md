# Why Choose Bot Maker For Discord
Note: I have tried being as un-biased as possible. The following statements are purely factual and not personal opinion.

The bot makers I will be comparing this app with will be the following: 
- Discord Bot Maker
- Discord Bot Builder
- Bot Studio for Discord

# Generalized usertypes
- I want the latest Discord API features without having the app -> BMD

- I'm fine with modding the app for extra features -> DBB, BMD\*, DBM\*
 - DBM-Mods doesn't include the latest Discord API v10 features.
 - BMD has a pretty wide range of mods, but you won't find yourself using them quite often since the app's base includes plenty of futures.

- I want stability & wouldn't mind having an outdated featureset -> DBM, BS(f)D\*
 - BS(f)D has a very mediocre base & mods cannot be used within events (which are used even by commands, in some cases). It's integration of slash commands, buttons and select menus is an afterthought and is not enjoyable for day-to-day usage.

- I want a bot maker with lots of video tutorials -> DBM, BS(f)D\*
 - A lot of BS(f)D tutorials are under the name of "Discord Bot Studio" due to a name change.

- I want an app that's in active development -> BMD\*, DBB\*
 - Rat is a human and cannot include more than a few suggestions in each update, therefore BMD may not always have the features you suggest.
 - DBB has shown little update activity recently. The app's developer went on a lengthy break before releasing an update. Developer claims they didn't take a break off and just fully rewrote the app.

- I want something that I can speedrun -> BMD, DBM

- I want something that's easily readable (allowing me pick up where I left off the next day after doing progress on command) -> BMD, DBM
 - Due to extreme similarities inbetween DBM and BMD, they are basically identical in this chapter.
 - Discord Bot Builder would've been included, but workspaces can get cluttered easily. 

- I'm an organization freak -> BMD, DBM

- I want customization -> BMD
